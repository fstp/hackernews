# Hackernews

Command line tool to print HackerNews articles related to a given topic. Very much a work in progress but currently
have caching (to avoid duplicate downloading) and downloads the entire list of top stories from HackerNews to a file
called "topstories.txt" which can be grepped for the relevant news. When completed the tools should have an option
for the user to provide a search term directly without having to use grep.
